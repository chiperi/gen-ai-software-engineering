# 🏦 Homework 1: Banking Transactions API

> **Student**: Elena Chiperi · **Date**: 01.07.2026 · **AI tool**: Claude (Cowork / Claude Code)

A minimal but production-quality REST API for banking transactions, built **test-first (TDD)**
in **Java 17 + Spring Boot 3**, with a companion **Angular 22 + Microsoft Fluent** frontend for
visual verification. The whole project was developed **with AI assistance**, following a
deliberate workflow: engineer a strong prompt → write a TDD plan → implement cycle by cycle →
verify locally → build the UI → polish. This README documents both the result and the
AI‑assisted process.

## 🎯 What was built

A banking transactions API with in‑memory storage (no database), fully covered by an automated
test suite (**53 tests, all green**), plus a polished single‑page UI and operability tooling
(health endpoint, interactive API reference). Everything starts with **one command**
(`./start.sh`).

## ✅ Features implemented

**Task 1 — Core API**

- `POST /transactions` — create a transaction (201, server‑assigned id/timestamp/status)
- `GET /transactions` — list transactions
- `GET /transactions/{id}` — fetch one (404 if missing)
- `GET /accounts/{accountId}/balance` — computed account balance

**Task 2 — Validation** (structured `400` errors)

- amount positive, ≤ 2 decimals; accounts match `ACC-XXXXX`; ISO 4217 currency; valid type.
  Errors return `{ "error": "Validation failed", "details": [{field, message}] }`.

**Task 3 — History / filtering** on `GET /transactions`

- `accountId` (from **or** to), `type`, inclusive `from`/`to` date range, combinable (AND).

**Task 4 — All four optional features**

- **A.** `GET /accounts/{id}/summary` — totals, count, most recent date
- **B.** `GET /accounts/{id}/interest?rate=&days=` — simple interest `balance * rate * days / 365`
- **C.** `GET /transactions/export?format=csv` — CSV download (`text/csv`, attachment)
- **D.** Rate limiting — 100 requests/min per IP, `429` when exceeded

**Operability**

- **Health**: `GET /actuator/health` (Spring Boot Actuator)
- **API reference**: `/docs` — rendered by **Scalar** (a modern alternative to Swagger UI) from
  the OpenAPI spec at `/v3/api-docs`. The frontend topbar shows a live API‑status chip and a link.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Layered Spring Boot application; money is always `BigDecimal` (never float/double).

```
backend/src/main/java/com/example/banking/
├── model/        Transaction (record) + Type/Status enums (lowercase JSON)
├── repository/   In-memory ConcurrentHashMap store
├── service/      TransactionService, BalanceService, SummaryService, InterestService, CsvExporter
├── validation/   @ValidCurrency + CurrencyValidator (java.util.Currency)
├── web/          Controllers + GlobalExceptionHandler (@RestControllerAdvice)
└── config/       RateLimiter + RateLimitFilter, OpenApiConfig, WebConfig
```

The frontend (`frontend/`) is Angular 22 — standalone components, signals, the new control
flow, zoneless change detection, lazy‑loaded routes, a typed API service over `HttpClient`, and
a **Microsoft Fluent** design system implemented with CSS design tokens (acrylic glass, brand
blue→cyan gradient, light/dark themes).

## 🤖 The AI‑assisted workflow (our interaction)

The project was built collaboratively with Claude. Rather than asking the AI to "write the app,"
the work followed a disciplined, verifiable loop. Here is the actual sequence of our interaction.

### 1. Engineering a professional prompt

We started by asking the AI to research **Anthropic's official prompt‑engineering best practices**
and produce a top‑tier prompt for the assignment. The result is [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md): a
prompt structured with XML tags (`<role>`, `<context>`, `<requirements>`, `<examples>`,
`<engineering_principles>`, `<definition_of_done>`, `<self_check>`), few‑shot request/response
examples, and an appendix mapping each section to the technique it applies (with the source link).
A parallel frontend prompt was produced as [`PROMPT-FRONTEND.md`](PROMPT-FRONTEND.md).

### 2. A test‑first plan

Before any code, we asked for a TDD implementation plan: [`PLAN-BACKEND-TDD.md`](PLAN-BACKEND-TDD.md).
It defines the Red → Green → Refactor discipline, the test pyramid (unit + MockMvc web tests +
one integration test), a `tests.json` tracker, and **nine ordered cycles**, each with the exact
tests to write first.

### 3. Cycle‑by‑cycle implementation (the core loop)

Because the sandbox couldn't run Java/Maven, we agreed on a **cycle‑by‑cycle** rhythm:

1. Claude writes the failing tests **and** the minimum code for one cycle.
2. Claude statically checks the code (package/path, brace balance, `tests.json` validity).
3. **I run `mvn test` locally** and report the result.
4. On green, we move to the next cycle; on red, Claude fixes it.

This kept a human in the loop as the verifier and made the AI's work auditable. Every cycle
came back green on the first local run. During Cycle 3, Claude proactively caught a bug before I
even ran it — a test helper named `post()` that shadowed MockMvc's static `post(...)` import —
and renamed it.

### 4. Refactors and structure

Mid‑way we reorganized the backend into a dedicated `backend/` folder and added a rule to
`PROMPT.md` that the backend must live there, keeping room for `frontend/` alongside.

### 5. Building the frontend

After the backend was complete, Claude scaffolded the Angular app with the official CLI, then
implemented the API service, models, feature views, routing, and a Fluent design system —
verifying it with `ng build` (clean compile).

### 6. Design iterations

We iterated on the UI several times: a full **"Microsoft 2030"** premium restyle (acrylic glass,
gradient accents, glow, motion, light/dark), a nicer **disabled‑button** state (soft brand tint
instead of gray text on the gradient), and equal‑width **filter fields** in the transactions row.

### 7. Developer experience & operability

Finally we added a **one‑command launcher** (`start.sh`) that runs backend + frontend, seeds
sample data (`demo/seed.sh`), and opens the browser; a **health** endpoint via Actuator; and a
modern **API reference** via Scalar at `/docs`, surfaced in the frontend topbar with a live
status chip.

## 🔁 TDD progression — every cycle

Each cycle was verified locally with `mvn test` before continuing. Test counts are cumulative.

| Cycle | Focus | New tests | Total |
|------:|-------|:---------:|:-----:|
| 0 | Walking skeleton (`GET /transactions` → `[]`) | 2 | 2 |
| 1 | Create & retrieve (model, repo, service, 404) | 7 | 9 |
| 2 | Validation & structured errors | 12 | 21 |
| 3 | Account balance | 7 | 28 |
| 4 | History / filtering | 5 | 33 |
| 5 | Account summary (Task 4A) | 4 | 37 |
| 6 | Simple interest (Task 4B) | 7 | 44 |
| 7 | CSV export (Task 4C) | 3 | 47 |
| 8 | Rate limiting (Task 4D) | 2 | 49 |
| 9 | End‑to‑end integration + hardening | 1 | 50 |
| — | Health + API reference (ops) | 3 | **53** |

Discipline throughout: never write code without a failing test; never weaken or delete a test to
get to green; money as `BigDecimal`; a general solution, not one hard‑coded to the tests.

### AI‑assisted development — the planning phase

These six screenshots capture how the project was set up with Claude, from first prompt to the
start of the TDD cycles.

![Kick-off and research](docs/screenshots/1.png)
*1 — Kick‑off: Claude reads the homework tasks and researches Anthropic's official
prompt‑engineering guidance before writing anything.*

![Delivering PROMPT.md](docs/screenshots/2.png)
*2 — Claude delivers `PROMPT.md`: a professional prompt built from Anthropic best practices
(Java + Spring Boot, all four Task 4 features, automated tests) with a technique→source mapping.*

![Frontend prompt request](docs/screenshots/3.png)
*3 — Next request: add an Angular 20 frontend with a Microsoft design. Claude researches
Angular 20 + Fluent and starts drafting `PROMPT-FRONTEND.md`.*

![Frontend prompt + TDD plan request](docs/screenshots/4.png)
*4 — The frontend prompt's contents (standalone/signals/new control flow, Fluent 2, dev proxy),
then the request to create a TDD implementation plan for the backend.*

![The TDD plan](docs/screenshots/5.png)
*5 — Claude produces `PLAN-BACKEND-TDD.md`: Red → Green → Refactor rules, the test pyramid, and
ten ordered cycles with a `tests.json` tracker.*

![Cycle-by-cycle workflow begins](docs/screenshots/6.png)
*6 — Environment check and the agreed workflow: the sandbox can't run Maven, so we go
cycle‑by‑cycle with local `mvn test`; Cycle 0 (walking skeleton) begins.*

### AI‑assisted development — the TDD cycles

The Red → Green → Refactor loop in action: Claude writes each cycle, I run `mvn test` locally
and report back before we continue.

![Cycle 0 delivered](docs/screenshots/7.png)
*7 — Cycle 0 delivered: the walking skeleton (`pom.xml`, app, `GET /transactions` → `[]`, first
two tests, `tests.json`). Claude notes it can't run Maven, so I verify locally.*

![Reorganize into backend/ and continue](docs/screenshots/8.png)
*8 — Cycle 0 passes (2/2). I ask to move the backend into a `backend/` folder and add that rule
to `PROMPT.md`; Claude reorganizes, updates the plan/docs, then proceeds to Cycle 1.*

![Cycle 1 implemented](docs/screenshots/9.png)
*9 — Cycle 1 (create & retrieve) implemented test‑first: `Transaction` model, in‑memory
repository, service, `POST`/`GET` endpoints and the 404 handler — expecting nine tests green.*

![Cycle 2 begins](docs/screenshots/10.png)
*10 — "9 tests passed — next." Cycle 2 begins: Bean Validation with a custom currency validator
and the structured `400` error body. (The same rhythm continued through Cycle 9.)*

### Tests

![All tests passing](docs/screenshots/11.png)
*11 — `mvn test` from `backend/`: all **53 tests pass** across the services, validators,
controllers, and the end‑to‑end integration test — `Tests run: 53, Failures: 0, Errors: 0`,
`BUILD SUCCESS`.*

### Backend running

![Backend started](docs/screenshots/12.png)
*12 — `mvn spring-boot:run`: the Spring Boot application boots and serves the API —
`Tomcat started on port 3000 (http)`, `Started BankingApplication`.*

### API, docs & health

![Sample API requests and responses](docs/screenshots/13.png)
*13 — Sample requests via `curl`: the transactions list, an account balance, and an account
summary returned as JSON.*

![Scalar API reference](docs/screenshots/14.png)
*14 — The interactive API reference at `/docs` (Scalar), listing the transaction and account
endpoints generated from the OpenAPI spec.*

![Health endpoint](docs/screenshots/15.png)
*15 — `GET /actuator/health` returning `{"status":"UP", ...}` (Spring Boot Actuator).*

### Frontend (Microsoft Fluent)

![Transactions UI — dark](docs/screenshots/16.png)
*16 — The transactions list (Microsoft Fluent, dark theme): acrylic glass surfaces, brand
gradient, filters, status badges, and the live "API online" chip in the topbar.*

![Transactions UI — light](docs/screenshots/17.png)
*17 — The same view in the light theme, toggled from the topbar.*

![Create transaction with validation](docs/screenshots/18.png)
*18 — The "New transaction" form with validation: invalid account format and a non‑positive
amount are flagged inline; the backend's `400 details[]` map to the same per‑field messages.*

![Account tools](docs/screenshots/19.png)
*19 — The Account tools page: balance, summary, and simple‑interest calculators, each backed by
its own endpoint (Tasks 1, 4A, 4B).*

![CSV export](docs/screenshots/20.png)
*20 — "Export CSV" downloads the transactions and opens them in a spreadsheet — a header row
plus one line per transaction (Task 4C).*

## 🏁 Results

- **All 4 required task groups + all 4 optional features** implemented.
- **53 automated tests**, all passing (`mvn test`).
- Clean, layered, well‑documented backend; `BigDecimal` money; centralized error handling.
- A polished **Angular 22 + Microsoft Fluent** UI that exercises every endpoint, verified with
  `ng build`.
- Operability: **health** endpoint and a modern **API reference** (Scalar).
- **One‑command** startup (`./start.sh`) with sample‑data seeding.

## ▶️ How to run

The fastest path, from `homework-1/`:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This starts the backend (`:3000`) and frontend (`:4200`), seeds sample data, and opens the
browser. Full manual instructions (prerequisites, tests, endpoints, health, docs) are in
**[HOWTORUN.md](HOWTORUN.md)**.

## 💭 Reflections on using AI

What worked well: forcing a **plan and tests first** made the AI's output verifiable and kept me
in control — I decided *what* to build and reviewed each step, the AI figured out *how*. Writing
a deliberate prompt from documented best practices paid off in the quality of the generated code.
Keeping a human‑run `mvn test` after every cycle caught issues early and built trust.

Challenges: the AI couldn't run Java/Maven in its environment, so verification happened on my
machine — which turned out to be a feature, not a bug, for a homework about *understanding* the
code. I read every change before accepting it rather than copy‑pasting blindly.
